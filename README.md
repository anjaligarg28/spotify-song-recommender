# spotify-song-recommender
Used spotify's api in python to get details of songs from user's playlist i.e., and then using our model to recommend songs to the user using collaborative filtering in python.


This project demonstrates the use of song features like accousticness, danceability, tempo, energy, popularity in recommending songs to the users, making app more interactive.

Clean and process the songs features dataset and then compare it to the user's playlist songs, apply cosine similarity and return the most similar songs as recommendations.
